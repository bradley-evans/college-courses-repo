From Bradley Evans:

The PWM was a very useful new feature to tack on to our state machines.
After SyncSM, the PWM seemed very intuitive and appealed to me after coming
from circuit analysis. I only wish that the PWM could output something other
than a square waveform.
I had responsibility for ensuring hardware was doing what it was
supposed to be doing as well as working Part 2 more independently than other
labs (as an individual exercise). My partner did the majority of the software
work. I also drafted state machines for this lab that eventually were
implemented in code.

From Braddley Carey:

The built in PWM is a useful and easy to understand concept.  The entire
lab was no more than two hours, of which a lot was just choosing a song
for the challenge section and translating it into notes.  I was concerned 
about the speaker when lab 6 was complicated enough to just get a couple
of notes out, but the PWM made it very easy.
I still have difficulty understanding how adjusting average amplitude of the
signal directly corresponds to a change in frequency from the speaker, but
I'll figure it out before the next lab.

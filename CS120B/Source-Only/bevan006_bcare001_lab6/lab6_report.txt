From Bradley Evans:

The most difficult component of the assignment was trying to properly
calculate periods to generate appropriate tones, and putting appropriate
limits in to keep the waveform within the limitations of the hardware.
Other than that, fairly straightforward.


From Bradd Carey:

Everything worked as expected, so there isn't much to report.  Also, 
there wasn't any new concepts since lab 7 is the pulse width 
modulation lab.

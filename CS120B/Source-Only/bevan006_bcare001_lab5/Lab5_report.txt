From Bradley Evans:

Implementation of these labs had some added complexity due to the added
timing factors but, overall, was straightforward. My partner performed most
of the hands-on programming of the code for this submission while I assisted
with hardware troubleshooting and soldiering (for the LCD display). I also
assisted with planning / diagramming the state machines for this lab.

From Braddley Carey:

I felt pretty lost on the timer stuff.  The lab specified to copy the code
given but the explanations given didn't make a lot of sense.  It was a few 
lectures later when TimerFlag and TimerISR was finally mentioned. I still don't
understand exactly why the other functions are needed, but we got everything
working.  That's the most important part.

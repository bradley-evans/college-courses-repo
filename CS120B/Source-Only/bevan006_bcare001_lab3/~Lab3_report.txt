From Bradley Evans:

Lab 3 was about reviewing finite state machines and learning about how they are
implemented in RIMS. The most difficult portion was likely learning how the
software took in our FSM and translates it into useable C.

The project was very simple, so there wasn't much of a way to divide up labor
effectively. Both of us wrote code independently and offered code snippets for
the other to use, however, Bradd did produce most of the code presented here in
this submission.

From Braddley Carey:
We wrote RIMS and simulated both part 1 and part 3 for practice.  I found RIMS a
bit confusing initially, but fairly intuitive after a bit of testing.  Both 
of the RIMS for part 1 and 3 are included.

I originally tried to jump the gun and program these out before we were taught
the double switch method in class and part 5 became very confusing and spaghetti
like.  After reprogramming each part in the method described in class I gained
a great respect for the organizational method of the double switch statements
for transitioning and state defined functions.

FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

for Bradley Evans and Braddley Carey

Summary:

A hardware-based cryptomodule.

The device will take data from an unencrypted (plaintext) flash drive, encrypt
the data according to some algorithm, and then write this data to another
flash drive. A second device will mirror this one and 

Components and Build Upons:

[Build Upon: USB Connectivity] A thumb drive will interface with a USB port
connected to the system. The ATMEga1284P will read from the drive and execute
an encryption algorithm, outputing the ciphertext onto another flash drive in 
another port.

[Build Upon: Bluetooth] The device will output decryption progress via
bluetooth, and an application will display the progress.

[Build Upon: Shift Register] The device will output decryption to an LCD,
which will attach to the microprocessor via a shift register.

[Build Upon: Arduino/Raspberry Pi integration, RFID] The device will require
authentication via an RFID card before it begins encryption/decryption.
Libraries will be used to implement the RFID components.

The device will implement a simple encryption algorithm. We are researching
precisely what algorithm we might use, but the following StackExchange thread
has good general coverage of my direction regarding the algorithm itself:

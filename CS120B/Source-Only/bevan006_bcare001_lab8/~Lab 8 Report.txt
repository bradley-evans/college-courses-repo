From Bradley Evans:

There were difficulties with the hardware during this experiment. Unfortunately,
a poorly-done chip movement on the breadboard had us dropping a +5V hot lead in
the ATMega's RESET pin rather than into the +5VCC pin as intended. This fried
the ATMega and caused us problems before the root cause was identified. 

From Braddley Carey:

I moved the chip and apparently couldn't count to 10 and burned the ATMega.
After replacing it with the spare the problems fell right into place. The
ADC I'm sure will come in handy for the project.  I'm trying to think of
a way to implement a joystick which requires 2 ADCs for each axis.  I look
forward to that challenge.

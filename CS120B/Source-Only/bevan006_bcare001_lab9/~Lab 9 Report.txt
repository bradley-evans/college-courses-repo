From Bradley Evans:

Lab 9 was straightforward because the periods lined up nicely. Originally,
I was operating in a single tick() with multiple switch statements, but
better encapsulated each state machine by challenge 3 by giving each state
machine its own function. Challenge 3 was a matter of making sure variables
appeared in a particular order in code, such that the "pulse flag" from each
button would actuate a later counter statement exactly once per cycle.

From Braddley Carey:

The idea of the concurrent SM greatly simplifies the building of the more
annoying to build SMs (PMW and ADC) come to mind.  The concept isn't
particularly difficult and we could have saved quite a few headaches by
learning this techinique _before_ going into PMWs.  This would also allow
us to make a challenging ADC because Lab 8's challenge was kind of a joke.
I would have like to use concurrent SMs to manage multiple ADCs
simultaneously.
